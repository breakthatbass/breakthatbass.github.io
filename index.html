                <p>My name is Taylor and I'm a software engineer living in southern NH. 
                    I'm interested in systems programming, embedded systems, and algorithms.
                    I also love playing tennis and getting outside. All my work is on 
                    <a href='https://github.com/breakthatbass' target='_blank'>github</a>.

                    It tries to cache everything it can to minimize calls to the AoC servers.
                    Uses the <a href='https://curl.se/libcurl/' target='_blank'>libcurl</a> C library.

                <p>
                    A collection of libraries I've built over time in C. There are a bunch of
                    string processing functions, a list library, a super simple header file timing
                    library, and a bunch of other pretty cool stuff. This repo is always growing.

                    Conway's game of life</a> algorithm in C. It reads from run length encoded

                    A tool to create documentation of C source files in Markdown format
                    based on comments in the code. It's sort of like Javadocs or Doxygen
                    except much simpler.

                    A tool to add and convert decimal, hexadecimal, and binary numbers.
                    It takes any number of arguments and attempts to add them together. It gives the sum in three forms:
                    decimal, hexadecimal, and binary.

                    by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The repo hold all my solutions to the exercises.
                    It's a massive book (like every CS book) so it's a work in progress. I get to it when I can.

                    over the winter during Covid. I (mostly) finished it as well as some of the <a href='https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects' target='_blank'>
